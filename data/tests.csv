Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism.

The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming PreQ1, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product.

When cellular nitrogen levels are high, the C-terminal adenylyl transferase (AT) inactivates GlnA by covalent transfer of an adenylyl group from ATP to specific tyrosine residue of GlnA, thus reducing its activity. Conversely, when nitrogen levels are low, the N-terminal adenylyl removase (AR) activates GlnA by removing the adenylyl group by phosphorolysis, increasing its activity.
